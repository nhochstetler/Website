        <p style="text-indent: 30px; color: white">
          Hello, my name is Nathan Hochstetler. By trade, I am a Naval Aviator with a background in program management, defense acquisition, and aviation operations. 
          Over the years, I’ve had the chance to lead some incredible teams, from flight lines to acquisition offices, working on everything 
          from safety systems to long-range planning. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding ways to bring together people, ideas, 
          and execution to make things happen. One of the things I’ve gotten really good at is making sense of ambiguity and breaking down 
          big-picture goals into clear, actionable plans, and helping diverse teams (engineers, operators, logisticians, you name it) stay 
          aligned and moving forward. Whether it's coordinating maintenance during a deployment or managing a fast-moving acquisition program, I love being in the middle of the action—especially when it means turning strategy into real-world results. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; color: white">
          Lately, I’ve been pivoting into product management, especially in the defense and dual-use tech space. I’ve been diving deep into the craft—learning through mentorship, self-study, and hands-on practice. I’m drawn to products that make a real impact, and I’m especially interested in the intersection of software, hardware, and mission-critical problems.
          On the technical side, I’m spending a lot of my spare time tinkering in Visual Studio Code, building up my Python skills, and even experimenting with basic AI language models. I’m not trying to be a full-time engineer—but I do want to understand how the tech works so I can help bridge the gap between builders and users.
          I’m especially excited about the future of autonomous systems, unmanned platforms, and how AI is shaping defense and national security. I try to bring a mix of structure, curiosity, and calm-under-pressure to every team I join—and I’m passionate about building the tools our servicemembers deserve to stay ahead in an increasingly complex world.
