    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
      Hi, I’m Nathan, a Naval Aviator with a background in program management, defense acquisition, and aviation operations. 
      Over the years, I’ve had the chance to lead some incredible teams, from flight lines to acquisition offices, working on everything 
      from safety systems to long-range planning. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding ways to bring together people, ideas, 
      and execution to make things happen. One of the things I’ve gotten really good at is making sense of ambiguity and breaking down 
      big-picture goals into clear, actionable plans, and helping diverse teams (engineers, operators, logisticians, you name it) stay 
      aligned and moving forward. Whether it's coordinating maintenance during a deployment or managing a fast-moving acquisition program, I love being in the middle of the action—especially when it means turning strategy into real-world results. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
      Lately, I’ve been pivoting into product management, especially in the defense and dual-use tech space. I’ve been diving deep into the craft—learning through mentorship, self-study, and hands-on practice. I’m drawn to products that make a real impact, and I’m especially interested in the intersection of software, hardware, and mission-critical problems.
      On the technical side, I’m spending a lot of my spare time tinkering in Visual Studio Code, building up my Python skills, and even experimenting with basic AI language models. I’m not trying to be a full-time engineer—but I do want to understand how the tech works so I can help bridge the gap between builders and users.
      I’m especially excited about the future of autonomous systems, unmanned platforms, and how AI is shaping defense and national security. I try to bring a mix of structure, curiosity, and calm-under-pressure to every team I join—and I’m passionate about building the tools our servicemembers deserve to stay ahead in an increasingly complex world.

  <a href="seabed-sentries.html" style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.3em; color: white;">Product Strategy: Maritime Defense</a>
  <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
    Dive into my thought process behind the Seabed Sentry System, an autonomous underwater maritime deterrence platform embedded on the 
    ocean floor, capable of detecting and tracking enemy vessels in real time.  </p>
  <a href="seabed-sentries.html" style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.3em; color: white;">Product Strategy: Air Defense</a>
  <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  The Lightweight Air Defense Interceptor blurs the line between missle and aircraft. It is an ultra-low-cost, runway-independent aircraft 
  designed solely to carry and launch two AIM-9X Sidewinders. Capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), it autonomously detects, engages, 
  and neutralizes airborne threats before returning to base for rapid rearming and redeployment.</p>
  <a href="seabed-sentries.html" style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.3em; color: white;">Targeting Optimization Software</a>
  <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
  Coded and built myself with Pyhon, this targeting software is an optimization algorithim that ingests real-time data from numerous 
  friendly assets and enemy targets to autonomously assign engagements. It maximizes combat effectiveness by determining the most 
  efficient pairing of shooters to targets, minimizing response time and resource usage while maximizing mission success.  
  The system is adaptable for both maritime and air operations, making it ideal for coordinated fleet defense, aerial intercepts, 
  and joint-domain engagements.</p>
